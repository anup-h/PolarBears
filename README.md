With elections just around the corner, we thought it would be interested to examine the political stances of various US politicians. Using the VADER sentiment analysis tool, we assigned scores to various politicians based on tweets that contained certain contentious issues. Then, using Principal Component Analysis and k-means clustering, we transformed and clustered the data. Finally, we built an interactive website using Dash and Plot.ly and deployed it using Heroku.
